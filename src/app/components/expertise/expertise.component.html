        I am a student at the Faculty of Cybernetics, Statistics and Economic
        Informatics - Economic Informatics profile at the Bucharest Academy of
        Economic Studies and I am looking for an opportunity to apply and
        develop my skills as a programmer. I have a passion for programming and
        I am willing to join an IT company where I can develop both
        professionally and socially. I like to meet new people and exchange
        experiences with them. I'm sure I would fit into a team without any
        problems.

      <div class="font-semibold text-gray-400 text-base">
        The first interaction with the web developing domain was in the 2nd year
        of college when I participated in a practice program where we made a
        full stack web application using Angular and SpringBoot. I liked it a
        lot so I started learning on my own by doing various smaller projects. I
        replaced SpringBoot with Laravel because it seems to me that it is
        easier to understand
